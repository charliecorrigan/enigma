# take in the encrypted message as an argument

# take in a part of the message that we know, which is nd..

# take the last 4 characters of the message

# backwards rotate the first character of that string until it is a n. keep track of that number.

# backwards rotate the second character of the string until it is a d. keep track of that number.

# backwards rotate the third character of the string until it is a period. keep track of that number.

# backwards rotate the fourth character of the string until it is a period. keep track of that number.

# we should now have a key. test that key to make sure that it works for e
